An interactive TUI script for easily mounting and unmounting QCOW2 and VDI virtual disk images using Network Block Devices (NBD) on Debian-based systems. Summon devices from the void like a true Discomancer!

---

## ‚ú® About The Project

This script provides a user-friendly `whiptail` terminal interface to simplify the process of using `qemu-nbd`. Instead of wrestling with complex commands, you can navigate through simple menus to:

- Connect a `.vdi` or `.qcow2` virtual disk image to an available `/dev/nbd*` device.
- Safely unmount all partitions on an NBD device.
- Disconnect the image from the NBD device.

It's designed to be intuitive, safe, and a little bit magical.

### üîÆ Features

*   **Interactive TUI:** Easy-to-use terminal menus powered by `whiptail`.
*   **Mount `.vdi` & `.qcow2`:** Supports the most common virtual disk formats.
*   **Auto-Dependency Check:** Automatically checks for `qemu-utils` and offers to install it.
*   **Smart Device Listing:** Shows which NBD slots are available and which are in use.
*   **Local Image Discovery:** Automatically finds compatible disk images in the current directory for quick selection.
*   **Safe Unmounting:** Intelligently finds and unmounts all filesystems on a device's partitions before disconnecting.
*   **Themed Interface:** A fun "Discomancer" wizard theme with ASCII art and emojis! üßô

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the script up and running.

### üìã Prerequisites

The script requires the following packages. Don't worry, it will try to install the main dependency for you!

*   `qemu-utils`: Provides the `qemu-nbd` command. The script will attempt to install this using `apt` if it's missing.
*   `whiptail`: Used for the dialog boxes. This is typically included in most base installations of Debian/Ubuntu.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LINUX-OASIS/NBD-MOUNT-VDI-QCOW.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NBD-MOUNT-VDI-QCOW
    ```
3.  Make the script executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x custom-NBD-MOUNT-VDI-QCOW.sh
    ```

### ü™Ñ Usage

Simply run the script with `sudo` or as a user with `sudo` privileges. The script needs elevated permissions to manage kernel modules and devices.

```sh
sudo ./custom-NBD-MOUNT-VDI-QCOW.sh
```

The script will guide you through an interactive menu to mount or unmount your disk images.

## üêß Compatibility

*   !Debian
*   !Ubuntu
*   !Linux Mint
